		Hi and welcome to my page.  My name is Will Battles and currently I am working through the UT Coding Bootcamp.  We are working through HTML, CSS and are now
		working through Bootstrap and Javascript.  I have skills outside of the camp that include C, JAVA and python.  I am looking foward though to continue the 
		expansion of my knowledge of computer languages and databases and really excited for the light at the end of the tunnel that leads to a job.
		</p>

		<p>
		In my spare time, I enjoy doing a wide variety of things.  I really enjoy sports and love the Texans, Rockets and Astros.  Which, coincidently, is a great time 
		to be an astro fan as we just clinched our 100th win of the season!  Then even though the Texans are 0-2, Watson has looked better and better every week so at 
		least there is some promise.  And hey, Rockets with CP3?  What a season to look foward too!
